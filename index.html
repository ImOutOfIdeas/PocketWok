            <p>Unfortunately this product does not exist. Anyway, this website has been carefully crafted using key features for ease of access and visual continuity. The persistent purchase button allows the user to have constant access to the albeit fictitious purchase page. The grid-block display allows discreet ideas to each be presented with a unique flair. Each of the images were created with photo shop using techniques developed throughout this course. I specifically chose colors that contrast heavily so each block adds to the separation effect. Each photo has been made to look as much like a stock photo as possible. This gives an appearance of officiality and incorporates the product accordingly. It goes without saying that this class helped me construct the Ad for Pocket Wok. The game, while technically was elementary. Using pixel art to give the game a more polished feel was key. A consistent topic in this class has been intentional design. I tried to capture that with the placement of the text around the image. This was exceptionally challenging given that I made the entire website by hand and the game was made with something called HTML Canvas. In other words, I used no external packages or code. I think it turned out pretty well. Also open developer tools and go to the console for a surprise.</p>
